## The source teaching

- **The Arrow (SN 36:6) — trans. Thanissaro Bhikkhu** — https://example.org/sn36-6.html
  The original two-arrows text. Short. Read it once early, return often.

## Talks

- **Patience — Thanissaro Bhikkhu (2026-06-12)** — https://example.org/patience.html
  Already in the library. Patience as not wearing the burden all the time.
  Reach for it when practice feels like grim endurance.

- **Anger Eating Demons — Ajahn Brahm (2011, 56 min)** — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7Wm5LOpx0
  The classic story-rich Brahm talk: the demon that grows on anger and shrinks
  on kindness. Reach for it when you want the teaching carried by a story
  instead of an argument.
